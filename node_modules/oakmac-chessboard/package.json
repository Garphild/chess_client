  "readme": "# chessboard.js\n\nchessboard.js is a JavaScript chessboard component. It depends on [jQuery].\n\nPlease see [chessboardjs.com] for documentation and examples.\n\n## What is chessboard.js?\n\nchessboard.js is a JavaScript chessboard component with a flexible \"just a\nboard\" API that\n\nchessboard.js is a standalone JavaScript Chess Board. It is designed to be \"just\na board\" and expose a powerful API so that it can be used in different ways.\nHere's a non-exhaustive list of things you can do with chessboard.js:\n\n- Use chessboard.js to show game positions alongside your expert commentary.\n- Use chessboard.js to have a tactics website where users have to guess the best\n  move.\n- Integrate chessboard.js and [chess.js] with a PGN database and allow people to\n  search and playback games (see [Example 5000])\n- Build a chess server and have users play their games out using the\n  chessboard.js board.\n\nchessboard.js is flexible enough to handle any of these situations with relative\nease.\n\n## What can chessboard.js **not** do?\n\nThe scope of chessboard.js is limited to \"just a board.\" This is intentional and\nmakes chessboard.js flexible for handling a multitude of chess-related problems.\n\nThis is a common source of confusion for new users. [remove?]\n\nSpecifically, chessboard.js does not understand anything about how the game of\nchess is played: how a knight moves, who's turn is it, is White in check?, etc.\n\nFortunately, the powerful [chess.js] library deals with exactly this sort of\nproblem domain and plays nicely with chessboard.js's flexible API. Some examples\nof chessboard.js combined with chess.js: 5000, 5001, 5002\n\nPlease see the powerful [chess.js] library for an API to deal with these sorts\nof questions.\n\n\nThis logic is distinct from the logic of the board. Please see the powerful\n[chess.js] library for this aspect of your application.\n\n\n\nHere is a list of things that chessboard.js is **not**:\n\n- A chess engine\n- A legal move validator\n- A PGN parser\n\nchessboard.js is designed to work well with any of those things, but the idea\nbehind chessboard.js is that the logic that controls the board should be\nindependent of those other problems.\n\n## Docs and Examples\n\n- Docs - <http://chessboardjs.com/docs>\n- Examples - <http://chessboardjs.com/examples>\n\n## License\n\nchessboard.js is released under the terms of the [MIT License].\n\n[jQuery]:https://jquery.com/\n[chessboardjs.com]:http://chessboardjs.com\n[chess.js]:https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js\n[Example 5000]:http://chessboardjs.com/examples#5000\n[MIT License]:LICENSE.md\n",
